{
    // Your code here
}
```
This snippet demonstrates the basic setup required to start using GroupDocs.Comparison in your application.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of extracting document information using this powerful tool.

### Step 1: Open the Source Document for Comparison

First, specify a source document. Replace `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\source.docx'` with the actual path to your file:
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(File.OpenRead(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\source.docx")))
{
    // Step 2: Add the target document for comparison.
    comparer.Add(File.OpenRead(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\target.docx"));
    
    // Step 3: Extract information from the target document.
    IDocumentInfo info = comparer.Targets.FirstOrDefault().GetDocumentInfo();
    
    // Output extracted information about the file type, number of pages, and size in bytes
    Console.WriteLine(
        $"File type: {info.FileType}\n" +
        $"Number of pages: {info.PageCount}\n" +
        $"Document size: {info.Size} bytes"
    );
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **Parameters**:
  - `comparer.Targets.FirstOrDefault()`: Retrieves the first document added for comparison.
  - `GetDocumentInfo()`: Extracts metadata about the target document.

- **Return Values**: 
  - `IDocumentInfo`: Contains details like file type, page count, and size.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure correct file paths to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Confirm that documents are accessible and not locked by other applications.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Comparison can be integrated into various real-world scenarios:
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automatically extract metadata for cataloging.
2. **Legal Document Review**: Compare versions of legal contracts efficiently.
3. **Academic Research**: Analyze research papers to identify content changes over time.
4. **Enterprise Content Management**: Track document revisions and maintain compliance.
