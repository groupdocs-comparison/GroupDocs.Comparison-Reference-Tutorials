# Get Document Info from Path - GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET

## Introduction
In the realm of software development, particularly in .NET framework environments, efficient document comparison is a critical necessity. Whether you're working on legal documents, code revisions, or any other content where precision matters, having a robust tool for comparing documents can save time, effort, and potential errors. One such powerful tool in this domain is GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET. This tutorial will guide you through the process of leveraging GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET to obtain document information from a given path, breaking down each step to ensure clarity and ease of implementation.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Environment Setup: Have a .NET development environment configured and ready.
2. GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET from the provided [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
3. Document to Compare: Prepare a document (e.g., DOCX, PDF) that you want to extract information from.
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics.

## Import Namespaces
In this section, we'll import the necessary namespaces to facilitate document comparison using GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Interfaces;
```

The System namespace is essential for basic I/O operations and console output, which we'll utilize in our example.

## Step 1: Initialize Comparer Object
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("SOURCE.docx"))
{
```
We create a new instance of the `Comparer` class, passing the path of the source document ("SOURCE.docx") as a parameter.
## Step 2: Retrieve Document Info
```csharp
    IDocumentInfo info = comparer.Source.GetDocumentInfo();
```
Using the `GetDocumentInfo()` method of the `Source` property, we obtain the document information, including file type, page count, and size.
## Step 3: Display Document Info
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("\nFile type: {0}\nNumber of pages: {1}\nDocument size: {2} bytes", info.FileType, info.PageCount, info.Size);
}
```
We print the extracted document information such as file type, page count, and size to the console for user visibility.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to utilize GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET to extract document information from a given path using C#. By following the step-by-step guide outlined above, you can seamlessly integrate document comparison functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing productivity and accuracy in document management tasks.
