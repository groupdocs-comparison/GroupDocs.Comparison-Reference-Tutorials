import java.io.File;

public class LicenseSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (new File("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath.lic").exists()) {
            License license = new License();
            license.setLicense("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath.lic");
        } else {
            System.out.println("License file not found. Some features may be limited.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting License from File

This feature is essential for enabling the full functionality of GroupDocs.Comparison.

#### Step 1: Check License File Existence
Verify if your license file exists at the specified path using `File.exists()`:

```java
import java.io.File;

if (new File("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath.lic").exists()) {
    // Proceed to set license
} else {
    System.out.println("License file not found.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Create License Instance
Create an instance of the `License` class, crucial for applying your license:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.license.License;

License license = new License();
```

#### Step 3: Set the License
Use the `setLicense()` method to apply the license file path and unlock all features:

```java
license.setLicense("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath.lic");
```
**Parameters and Method Purpose**: The `setLicense(String)` method takes a string parameter representing the full path to your license file, unlocking additional functionalities within GroupDocs.Comparison.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: License file not found.
  - **Solution**: Double-check the file path for typos or incorrect directory references.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Review Workflows**: Automate comparison tasks in legal and financial document reviews.
2. **Version Control Systems**: Track changes across different versions of technical documents.
3. **Content Management**: Ensure consistency in corporate communications by comparing updated drafts with previous versions.

Integration opportunities abound, especially when combined with other GroupDocs tools or external systems for enhanced workflow automation.
