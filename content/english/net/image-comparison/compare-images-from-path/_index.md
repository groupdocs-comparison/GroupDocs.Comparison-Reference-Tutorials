### 2. Obtain a License
To unlock the full potential of GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET, acquire a license from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or utilize the temporary license available [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
### 3. Familiarity with C# Programming
A basic understanding of C# programming language is necessary to implement the comparison functionalities effectively.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project to access the functionalities of GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;
```

Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps to effectively compare images using GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET:
## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.png");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path where you want the comparison result to be stored.
## Step 2: Initialize Comparer Object
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("SOURCE.png"))
```
Create a new instance of the `Comparer` class by providing the path of the source image (`"SOURCE.png"` in this example).
## Step 3: Configure Comparison Options
```csharp
CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions();
options.GenerateSummaryPage = false;
```
Customize the comparison options as per your requirements. In this case, we're setting `GenerateSummaryPage` to `false` to exclude the summary page from the output.
## Step 4: Add Target Image for Comparison
```csharp
comparer.Add("TARGET.png");
```
Add the target image (`"TARGET.png"`) to compare it against the source image.
## Step 5: Perform Comparison and Save Result
```csharp
comparer.Compare(outputFileName, options);
```
Execute the comparison process and save the result to the specified output file (`"RESULT.png"`).
## Step 6: Display Output Location
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nImages compared successfully.\nCheck output in {Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()}.");
```
Inform the user about the successful completion of the comparison process and provide the location where the result is saved.
