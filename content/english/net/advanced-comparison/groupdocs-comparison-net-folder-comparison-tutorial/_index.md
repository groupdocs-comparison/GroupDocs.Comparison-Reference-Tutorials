- Familiarity with file system operations in .NET.

With these prerequisites covered, letâ€™s set up GroupDocs.Comparison for your project!

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET

To integrate GroupDocs.Comparison into your project, you need to install the library. Here's how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Comparison -Version 25.4.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Comparison --version 25.4.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

To start using GroupDocs.Comparison, you can opt for a free trial or purchase a license:
- **Free Trial**: Access all features with limited usage.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license to evaluate full capabilities.
- **Purchase**: Buy a license for long-term use.

You can manage licenses by applying them in your code, ensuring access to all functionalities.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how to initialize GroupDocs.Comparison in your C# application:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the license if available
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense("Path to your license file");

        Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET is ready to use.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's implement folder comparison and save results as TXT or HTML files using GroupDocs.Comparison.

### Compare Folders and Save Results as TXT

#### Overview
This feature allows you to compare two folders and output the differences in a text file, making it easy to review changes line by line.

#### Step 1: Configure Comparison Options

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;

string sourceFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SOURCE_FOLDER";
string targetFolder = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/TARGET_FOLDER";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Set comparison options for TXT output
Options.CompareOptions compareOptionsTxt = new Options.CompareOptions
{
    DirectoryCompare = true,
    FolderComparisonExtension = GroupDocs.Comparison.Options.FolderComparisonExtension.Txt
};
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Comparer Object

```csharp
Comparer comparerTxt = new Comparer(sourceFolder, compareOptionsTxt);
// Add target folder for comparison
comparerTxt.Add(targetFolder, compareOptionsTxt);
```

#### Step 3: Perform Comparison and Save Result

```csharp
string txtOutputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ComparisonResult.txt");
comparerTxt.Compare(txtOutputFileName, compareOptionsTxt);

Console.WriteLine("TXT file with comparison results saved successfully.");
```

### Compare Folders and Save Results as HTML

#### Overview
This feature helps you visualize differences by generating an HTML report that highlights changes.

#### Step 1: Configure Comparison Options for HTML Output

```csharp
// Set comparison options for HTML output
Options.CompareOptions compareOptionsHtml = new Options.CompareOptions
{
    DirectoryCompare = true,
    FolderComparisonExtension = GroupDocs.Comparison.Options.FolderComparisonExtension.Html
};
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Comparer Object for HTML

```csharp
Comparer comparerHtml = new Comparer(sourceFolder, compareOptionsHtml);
// Add target folder to the comparison
comparerHtml.Add(targetFolder, compareOptionsHtml);
```

#### Step 3: Perform Comparison and Save Result as HTML

```csharp
string htmlOutputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ComparisonResult.html");
comparerHtml.Compare(htmlOutputFileName, compareOptionsHtml);

Console.WriteLine("HTML file with comparison results saved successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure directory paths are correctly specified.
- Check for write permissions in the output directory.
- Verify that all necessary files and dependencies are present.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where folder comparison can be beneficial:
1. **Code Review**: Compare different versions of a codebase to identify changes.
2. **Data Backup Verification**: Ensure backups match original data folders.
3. **Configuration Management**: Track changes in configuration files across environments.
4. **Document Versioning**: Maintain consistency in document updates and revisions.
5. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate comparison checks as part of deployment processes.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Comparison:
- Minimize the number of files within each folder to reduce processing time, if possible.
- Use efficient data structures for file storage and access.
- Monitor memory usage and manage resources effectively in .NET applications.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to implement folder comparison with GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET, saving results as TXT or HTML. These skills will enhance your ability to manage and compare large datasets efficiently.

As next steps, consider exploring more advanced features of GroupDocs.Comparison, such as comparing specific file types or integrating the tool into larger applications.
