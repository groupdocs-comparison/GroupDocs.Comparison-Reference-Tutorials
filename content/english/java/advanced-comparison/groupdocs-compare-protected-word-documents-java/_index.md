   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Environment Setup Requirements

- Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher is installed.
- Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for running Java applications.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

Familiarity with Java programming and handling file streams is beneficial. If you're new to these concepts, consider reviewing them before proceeding.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Comparison for Java

To use **GroupDocs.Comparison for Java**, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Maven Dependency**: Include the GroupDocs.Comparison library in your project's `pom.xml` as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**: Obtain a free trial, request a temporary license, or purchase a full version from the [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) to use all features without limitations during development.

### Basic Initialization

Here's how to initialize and set up your project:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.Comparer;
import java.io.FileInputStream;

public class InitializeComparer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load a protected document with password using FileInputStream
        try (FileInputStream sourceStream = new FileInputStream("source_protected.docx")) {
            Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceStream, new LoadOptions("1234"));
            // You can now use 'comparer' for further operations
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's explore the key features of loading and comparing protected documents.

### Loading Protected Documents from Streams

#### Overview

This feature allows you to load password-protected Word documents using InputStreams, seamlessly integrating with your file handling workflows.

##### Step-by-step Implementation

**Step 1:** Create a `Comparer` instance by loading the source document with its password.

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.Comparer;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import com.groupdocs.comparison.options.load.LoadOptions;

public class Feature_LoadProtectedDocuments {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String sourcePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source_protected.docx";
        // Load the source document with password
        try (InputStream sourceStream = new FileInputStream(sourcePath)) {
            Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceStream, new LoadOptions("1234"));
```

**Step 2:** Add target documents by loading them through InputStreams and specifying their passwords.

```java
            String target1Path = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/target1_protected.docx";
            try (InputStream target1Stream = new FileInputStream(target1Path)) {
                comparer.add(target1Stream, new LoadOptions("5678"));
            }
```

**Step 3:** Repeat for additional documents as needed.

```java
            String target2Path = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/target2_protected.docx";
            try (InputStream target2Stream = new FileInputStream(target2Path)) {
                comparer.add(target2Stream, new LoadOptions("5678"));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Configuration Options

- **LoadOptions**: Specify the password for each document to ensure secure access.
- **Comparer.add()**: Use this method to add multiple documents into the comparison process.

### Comparing Documents and Writing to Output Stream

#### Overview

After loading the documents, you can compare them and output the result directly to a file using an OutputStream.

##### Step-by-step Implementation

**Step 1:** Initialize your output stream where the results will be saved.

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class Feature_CompareDocuments {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/result.docx";
        try (OutputStream resultStream = new FileOutputStream(outputPath)) {
```

**Step 2:** Perform the comparison and save the output.

```java
            // Assuming 'comparer' is already initialized with source and target streams
            comparer.compare(resultStream);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all document paths are correct to prevent `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that passwords provided in `LoadOptions` match those of the documents.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where these features can be applied:

1. **Legal Document Management**: Compare different versions of contracts or agreements.
2. **Academic Research**: Evaluate multiple research papers for plagiarism detection.
3. **Financial Audits**: Cross-check financial reports from various departments.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Comparison in Java applications, consider the following:

- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Use try-with-resources to manage streams efficiently.
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverage multithreading where possible for handling large documents.
- **Resource Management**: Close streams promptly to free up system resources.

## Conclusion

By now, you should be well-equipped to load and compare password-protected Word documents using GroupDocs.Comparison in Java. This powerful feature streamlines document management tasks and enhances productivity by automating comparison processes.
