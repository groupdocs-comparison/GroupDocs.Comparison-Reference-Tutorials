# Document Comparison .NET: Accept & Reject Changes Programmatically

## Why Document Comparison Matters (And Why You're Probably Doing It Wrong)

If you're still manually comparing documents and tracking changes by eye, you're wasting precious hours that could be spent on actual development. Here's the thing: **document comparison .NET** solutions can automate 90% of your document workflow headaches, and I'm about to show you exactly how.

Whether you're building a content management system, handling legal document reviews, or managing collaborative editing workflows, programmatic document comparison isn't just nice to have—it's essential for any serious application.

In this guide, you'll master **GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET** to accept and reject changes programmatically. No more tedious manual reviews, no more version control nightmares. Just clean, automated document workflows that actually work.

### What You'll Walk Away With
By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:
- Set up document comparison .NET functionality in minutes (not hours)
- Accept reject changes programmatically with surgical precision  
- Handle real-world scenarios that trip up most developers
- Optimize performance when dealing with large document sets
- Troubleshoot common issues before they derail your project

Let's dive in—starting with what you need to get this working.

## Before You Start: Essential Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need to follow along (and actually get this working in your project):

- **.NET Framework 4.6.1 or later** - older versions won't cut it
- **Basic C# knowledge** - you should be comfortable with classes and methods
- **Visual Studio** (or your preferred IDE) set up and ready
- **5 minutes** to install the GroupDocs package

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET (The Right Way)

Most tutorials skip the nuances here, but getting the setup right saves you debugging headaches later. Here's how to do it properly:

### Installation Options

**Option 1: NuGet Package Manager Console** (Recommended)
```
Install-Package GroupDocs.Comparison -Version 25.4.0
```

**Option 2: .NET CLI** (If you prefer command line)
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Comparison --version 25.4.0
```

### Licensing (Don't Skip This Step)

Here's where many developers stumble. GroupDocs.Comparison needs proper licensing for production use. Your options:

1. **Start with the free trial** - perfect for testing: [Download here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/)
2. **Get a temporary license** - for extended evaluation: [Request here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)  
3. **Full license** - for production deployment: [Purchase here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy)

### Basic Setup and Initialization

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Comparison in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
```

That's it for setup. Simple, right? Now let's get to the interesting part—actually comparing documents and managing changes.

## The Complete Implementation Guide

This is where we get practical. I'll walk you through a real-world implementation that you can adapt for your specific needs.

### Understanding the Accept/Reject Workflow

Before jumping into code, let's clarify what we're building. **Document comparison .NET** with GroupDocs works like this:

1. **Compare** two documents to identify differences
2. **Analyze** the changes found during comparison  
3. **Decide** which changes to accept or reject
4. **Apply** your decisions to generate the final document

This workflow gives you surgical control over document revisions—perfect for approval processes, collaborative editing, or automated content management.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up Your File Paths (Do This Right)

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "SOURCE_WORD");
string targetFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "TARGET_WORD");
string acceptedChangesOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT_WITH_ACCEPTED_CHANGE_WORD");
string rejectedChangesOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT_WITH_REJECTED_CHANGE_WORD");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Comparison and Detect Changes

```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceFilePath))
{
    comparer.Add(targetFilePath);
    comparer.Compare();
    ChangeInfo[] changes = comparer.GetChanges();
}
```

This code does the heavy lifting—comparing your documents and identifying every single difference. The `changes` array contains detailed information about each modification found.

#### Step 3: Reject Changes Programmatically

When you need to reject a specific change:

```csharp
changes[0].ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Reject;
comparer.ApplyChanges(rejectedChangesOutputFile, new ApplyChangeOptions { Changes = changes, SaveOriginalState = true });
```

**Why `SaveOriginalState = true`?** This preserves the original formatting and structure—crucial for maintaining document integrity.

#### Step 4: Accept Changes You Want

To accept changes instead:

```csharp
changes[0].ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Accept;
comparer.ApplyChanges(acceptedChangesOutputFile, new ApplyChangeOptions { Changes = changes });
```

### Real-World Implementation Tips

**Batch Processing Multiple Changes**
```csharp
// Accept all insertions, reject all deletions
foreach (var change in changes)
{
    if (change.Type == ChangeType.Inserted)
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Accept;
    else if (change.Type == ChangeType.Deleted)
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Reject;
}
```

**Conditional Change Management**
```csharp
// Only accept changes from specific authors
foreach (var change in changes)
{
    if (change.Authors.Contains("TrustedUser"))
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Accept;
    else
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Reject;
}
```

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### File Path Problems
**Symptoms**: FileNotFoundException or access denied errors
**Solution**: Always verify file paths exist and your application has read/write permissions
```csharp
if (!File.Exists(sourceFilePath))
    throw new FileNotFoundException($"Source file not found: {sourceFilePath}");
```

### Memory Issues with Large Documents  
**Symptoms**: OutOfMemoryException when processing large files
**Solution**: Process documents in chunks or increase available memory
```csharp
// Configure comparison settings for large files
CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions()
{
    DetectStyleChanges = false, // Reduces memory usage
    GenerateSummaryPage = false
};
```

### Unsupported Document Formats
**Symptoms**: Format not supported exceptions
**Solution**: Verify format compatibility before processing
```csharp
var supportedFormats = new[] { ".docx", ".doc", ".pdf", ".txt" };
string extension = Path.GetExtension(sourceFilePath).ToLower();
if (!supportedFormats.Contains(extension))
    throw new NotSupportedException($"Format {extension} not supported");
```

## Real-World Use Cases That Actually Matter

### 1. Legal Document Review Workflow
Law firms use this approach to manage contract revisions. Senior partners can programmatically accept certain clause changes while rejecting others based on predefined rules.

### 2. Content Management Systems
Publishing platforms use **document comparison .NET** to handle editorial workflows. Writers submit revisions, editors review changes programmatically, and only approved content goes live.

### 3. Collaborative Software Development Documentation  
Technical writing teams use this to manage documentation updates. Changes from trusted contributors get auto-accepted, while others require manual review.

### 4. Compliance and Audit Trails
Organizations create detailed change logs by programmatically analyzing document modifications. This provides complete audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## Performance Optimization: Make It Fast

### Memory Management Best Practices
```csharp
// Always dispose properly
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Your comparison logic here
} // Automatically disposed here
```

### Batch Processing Strategy
For multiple documents:
```csharp
// Process in batches to avoid memory overload
const int batchSize = 10;
for (int i = 0; i < documents.Count; i += batchSize)
{
    var batch = documents.Skip(i).Take(batchSize);
    ProcessDocumentBatch(batch);
    GC.Collect(); // Force garbage collection between batches
}
```

### Configuration Tuning
```csharp
CompareOptions options = new CompareOptions()
{
    DetectStyleChanges = false,        // Skip formatting changes for speed
    GenerateSummaryPage = false,       // Skip summary generation  
    CalculateCoordinates = false       // Skip position calculations
};
```

## Advanced Techniques for Power Users

### Custom Change Filtering
```csharp
// Create custom filters for specific change types
var importantChanges = changes.Where(c => 
    c.Type == ChangeType.Inserted && 
    c.Text.Length > 10 &&
    !c.Text.Contains("temp")).ToArray();
```

### Automated Decision Rules
```csharp
// Implement business rules for automatic decisions
public ComparisonAction DecideOnChange(ChangeInfo change)
{
    if (change.Authors.Contains("Admin")) return ComparisonAction.Accept;
    if (change.Text.Contains("TODO")) return ComparisonAction.Reject;
    return ComparisonAction.None; // Manual review needed
}
```
