## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, managing and comparing documents efficiently is crucial. Whether you're working on legal contracts, financial reports, or any other document-intensive application, the ability to compare documents accurately can save time and ensure accuracy. This is where GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET comes into play. 
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET framework.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
- Access to the GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET documentation [here](https://tutorials.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).

## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Here's how you can do it:

In your project, add the following namespace tutorialss at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
These namespaces provide access to essential classes and methods required for document comparison tasks.

## Step 1: Check License File Existence
```csharp
if (File.Exists(Constants.LicensePath))
{
```
This step checks if the license file exists in the specified path.
## Step 2: Set License from Stream
```csharp
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead(Constants.LicensePath))
{
    License license = new License();
    license.SetLicense(stream);
}
```
If the license file exists, this step creates a file stream to read the license file and sets the license for GroupDocs.Comparison using the `SetLicense` method.
## Step 3: Handle License Absence
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
```
If the license is set successfully, this step prints a success message.
## Step 4: Prompt for Obtaining License
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nWe do not ship any license with this example. " +
                  "\nVisit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
                  "\nLearn more about licensing at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing. " +
                  "\nLear how to request temporary license at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license.");
```
If the license file doesn't exist, this step prompts the user to obtain a license from the GroupDocs website.
