## Introduction
In the world of software development, efficient and accurate document comparison is crucial for various industries, including legal, finance, and education. GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET provides a comprehensive solution for comparing protected documents effortlessly within your .NET applications. This tutorial will guide you through the process of comparing protected documents step by step using GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
2. Protected Documents: Prepare the source and target documents that you want to compare. Ensure that these documents are password-protected.

## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project to access the functionalities of GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;
```

## Step 1: Set Output Directory and File Name
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.docx");
```
In this step, you define the directory where the compared document will be saved (`outputDirectory`) and specify the name of the output file (`outputFileName`).
## Step 2: Initialize Comparer
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("SOURCE.docx"_PROTECTED, new LoadOptions(){ Password = "1234" }))
```
Here, we initialize a new instance of the `Comparer` class, passing the path to the source document (`SOURCE.docx_PROTECTED`) and specifying load options with the password (`1234`) required to open the source document.
## Step 3: Add Target Document and Load Options
```csharp
comparer.Add("TARGET.docx"_PROTECTED, new LoadOptions() { Password = "5678" });
```
Next, we add the target document (`TARGET.docx_PROTECTED`) along with its load options containing the password (`5678`) required to open the target document.
## Step 4: Perform Comparison
```csharp
comparer.Compare(outputFileName);
```
In this step, we perform the document comparison using the `Compare` method of the `Comparer` class, specifying the output file name where the compared document will be saved.
## Step 5: Display Output Location
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocuments compared successfully.\nCheck output in {Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()}.");
```
Finally, we display a message confirming the successful comparison and provide the location where the compared document is saved.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET simplifies the process of comparing protected documents, offering developers a powerful tool to enhance document management workflows. By following this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate document comparison functionality into your .NET applications.
