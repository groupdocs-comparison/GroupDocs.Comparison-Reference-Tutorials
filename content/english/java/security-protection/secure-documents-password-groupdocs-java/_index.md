# Secure Your Documents with a Password Using GroupDocs.Comparison for Java

In today's digital age, ensuring the security of your documents is paramount. Unauthorized access can lead to significant data breaches. This tutorial will guide you through securing your resultant document with a password using **GroupDocs.Comparison for Java**â€”a robust library designed for comparing various document formats seamlessly.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up GroupDocs.Comparison in your Java project
- Steps to protect documents with passwords
- Key configuration options and their implications
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues

Let's dive into setting up your environment and implementing this essential feature.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Required Libraries:**
   - GroupDocs.Comparison version 25.2 or later.
   
2. **Environment Setup Requirements:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
   - An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of Java programming.
   - Familiarity with Maven for dependency management.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Comparison for Java

To get started, you'll need to include GroupDocs.Comparison in your project using Maven. Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-comparison</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs.Comparison offers a free trial, which you can use to explore its features. For extended usage:
- **Free Trial:** Download and try out the library without limitations.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for full-feature access.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing a license for long-term projects.

### Basic Initialization

Once your environment is set up, initialize GroupDocs.Comparison as follows:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.Comparer;

try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("source_document.docx")) {
    // Your code here
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you're ready, let's explore how to secure your documents with a password.

### Step 1: Initialize the Comparer Object

Begin by creating an instance of the `Comparer` class. This object will handle document comparisons:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.Comparer;

try (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("source_document.docx")) {
    // Add and compare documents in subsequent steps
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Step 2: Add Target Document

Add the target document you wish to compare against your source file:

```java
comparer.add("target1_document.docx");
```

**Why This Matters:** Adding a target document is essential for comparison, as it sets the baseline for detecting differences.

### Step 3: Configure SaveOptions with Password

Set up `SaveOptions` to include password protection for your resultant document:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.options.save.SaveOptions;

SaveOptions saveOptions = new SaveOptions.Builder()
        .setPassword("3333")  // Set the desired password here
        .build();
```

### Step 4: Configure CompareOptions

Determine who can access the protected document using `CompareOptions`:

```java
import com.groupdocs.comparison.options.CompareOptions;
import com.groupdocs.comparison.options.enums.PasswordSaveOption;

CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions.Builder()
        .setPasswordSaveOption(PasswordSaveOption.USER)  // Specify user access level
        .build();
```

### Step 5: Perform Comparison and Save

Finally, execute the comparison and save your secured document:

```java
import java.nio.file.Path;

final Path resultPath = comparer.compare("SetPasswordForResultantDocument.docx\
