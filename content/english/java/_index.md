### [Advanced Comparison](./advanced-comparison)
Compare multiple documents simultaneously, adjust sensitivity settings, and handle password-protected files with custom comparison configurations. Great for complex enterprise scenarios.

### [Document Information](./document-information)
Extract and display metadata like page count, format type, and supported file extensions before running comparisons. Essential for building user-friendly interfaces.

### [Preview Generation](./preview-generation)
Generate high-quality preview pages for source, target, and result files â€“ perfect for frontend comparison visualizations and user dashboards.

### [Metadata Management](./metadata-management)
Modify metadata in source and result documents. Set or preserve custom properties during or after comparison â€“ crucial for document management systems.

### [Security & Protection](./security-protection)
Work with encrypted documents and apply protection settings to output files to prevent unauthorized access. Must-have for sensitive document workflows.

### [Licensing & Configuration](./licensing-configuration)
Manage license activation, use metered licensing, and configure default comparison options in your Java project. Get your environment production-ready.

### [Comparison Options](./comparison-options)
Customize comparison output â€“ ignore case, formatting, headers, and more. Tailor the comparison engine to your specific document requirements.


## Getting Started: Your First 5 Minutes

**Quick setup checklist:**
1. **Add the dependency** â€“ Maven or Gradle integration
2. **Initialize the comparison** â€“ Basic two-file comparison
3. **Choose your output format** â€“ PDF, DOCX, or HTML results
4. **Test with sample files** â€“ Verify everything works
5. **Customize settings** â€“ Adjust sensitivity and formatting options

**Pro tip:** Start with the [Basic Comparison](./basic-comparison) section if you want to see results immediately, then dive deeper into specific features as needed.

## Performance Considerations

**For large-scale applications:**
- **Memory management** â€“ Stream processing for large files
- **Batch processing** â€“ Handle multiple comparisons efficiently  
- **Caching strategies** â€“ Optimize repeated comparisons
- **Threading** â€“ Parallel processing for bulk operations

**Integration best practices:**
- Use dependency injection for configuration management
- Implement proper error handling for unsupported formats
- Set up logging for comparison operations monitoring
- Consider file size limits for web applications

## Common Issues & Solutions

**"Comparison taking too long on large files?"**
- Enable streaming mode for files > 50MB
- Adjust comparison sensitivity settings
- Consider splitting large documents into sections

**"Getting formatting differences I don't care about?"**
- Use comparison options to ignore specific formatting
- Focus on text-only changes for content review
- Configure white-space and case sensitivity settings

**"Need to compare files from different sources?"**
- Load documents from streams, URLs, or cloud storage
- Handle different encoding formats properly
- Implement proper authentication for protected sources


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I compare different file formats (like DOCX vs PDF)?**
A: Yes! GroupDocs.Comparison supports cross-format comparison, though results work best with similar document types.

**Q: How do I handle password-protected documents?**
A: The library includes built-in support for encrypted files â€“ just provide the password during document loading.

**Q: Is there a limit on document size?**
A: While there's no hard limit, performance is optimized for typical business documents. For very large files, consider using streaming mode.

**Q: Can I customize what changes are detected?**
A: Absolutely. You can configure the comparison engine to ignore formatting, case changes, whitespace, or specific document elements.

**Q: Does it work with scanned documents or images?**
A: Yes, but for text extraction from images, you'll get better results with OCR preprocessing before comparison.
