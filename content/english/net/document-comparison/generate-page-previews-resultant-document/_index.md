## Introduction
In the world of software development, comparing documents efficiently and accurately is paramount. Whether you're working on a project that involves collaboration among team members or dealing with legal documents, being able to compare versions effectively can save time and ensure accuracy. GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET is a powerful tool designed to streamline the document comparison process for .NET developers. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to use GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET to generate page previews for resultant documents. We'll break down each step to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the process.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET: Ensure that you have installed GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
2. Basic Understanding of .NET: Familiarity with .NET framework and C# programming language will be helpful to follow along with this tutorial.
3. Document Files: You'll need the source and target document files that you want to compare. Make sure you have them ready.
4. Development Environment: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE for .NET development.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET functionalities.
## Step 1: Import Namespaces
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```
Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps to understand each part thoroughly.
### Step 1: Set Output Directory and File Name
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.docx");
```
In this step, we define the output directory where the resultant document will be saved and specify the name for the resultant file.
## Step 2: Initialize Comparer and Add Documents
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("SOURCE.docx"))
{
    comparer.Add("TARGET.docx");
```
Here, we initialize the `Comparer` object by providing the path of the source document. Then, we add the target document that we want to compare with the source document.
## Step 3: Compare Documents and Generate Output
```csharp
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(outputFileName));
```
This step compares the source and target documents and generates the resultant document based on the comparison. The output file is created at the specified location.
## Step 4: Generate Page Previews
```csharp
    Document document = new Document(File.OpenRead(outputFileName));
    PreviewOptions previewOptions = new PreviewOptions(pageNumber =>
    {
        var pagePath = Path.Combine(Constants.SamplesPath, $"result_{pageNumber}.png");
        return File.Create(pagePath);
    });
    previewOptions.PreviewFormat = PreviewFormats.PNG;
    previewOptions.PageNumbers = new int[] { 1, 2 };
    document.GeneratePreview(previewOptions);
}
```
In this final step, we generate page previews for the resultant document. We specify the format of the previews (in this case, PNG) and the page numbers for which we want previews to be generated.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET offers a convenient and efficient way to compare documents and generate page previews. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate document comparison functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing productivity and accuracy.
