```

## Implementation Guide
### Accepting and Rejecting Revisions
#### Overview
This feature allows you to programmatically accept or reject changes made in Word documents. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Load the Document**

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;

// Load document revisions
comparer.Add("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source_revisions.docx");
```

#### Understanding Parameters
- **Add**: This method loads the source document for comparison.

**Step 2: Get Revisions**
Retrieve all changes to evaluate which ones to accept or reject.
```csharp
// Fetch revisions from loaded documents
List<ChangeInfo> revisions = comparer.GetChanges();
```

#### Method Details
- **GetChanges**: Returns a list of detected changes (revisions) in the document.

**Step 3: Accept/Reject Changes**
Decide which changes to keep and which to discard.
```csharp
// Accept certain changes, reject others
foreach(var change in revisions)
{
    if (/* condition to accept */)
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Accept;
    else
        change.ComparisonAction = ComparisonAction.Reject;
}

// Apply the revisions
comparer.ApplyChanges(outputDirectoryAccepted);
```

#### Configuration Options
- **ComparisonAction**: Determines whether a revision is accepted or rejected.

**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure document paths are correctly specified.
