## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to compare multiple documents efficiently using GroupDocs Comparison for .NET. This powerful library allows developers to integrate document comparison capabilities into their .NET applications seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the comparison process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs Comparison for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a suitable development environment set up with .NET capabilities.
3. Documents to Compare: Prepare the source document and the target documents that you want to compare.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your .NET application:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;
```
## Step 1: Set Output Directory and Filename
Define the directory where you want to save the comparison result and specify the output filename:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.docx");
```
## Step 2: Initialize Comparer and Add Documents
Initialize the comparer object and add the source document and multiple target documents for comparison:
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(File.OpenRead("SOURCE.docx")))
{
    comparer.Add(File.OpenRead("TARGET.docx"));
    comparer.Add(File.OpenRead("TARGET2.docx"));
    comparer.Add(File.OpenRead("TARGET3.docx"));
```
## Step 3: Configure Comparison Options
Configure the comparison options such as inserted item style, specifying how the compared documents should be presented:
```csharp
    CompareOptions compareOptions = new CompareOptions()
    {
        InsertedItemStyle = new StyleSettings()
        {
            FontColor = Color.Yellow
        }
    };
```
## Step 4: Perform Comparison and Save Result
Perform the document comparison and save the result to the specified output file:
```csharp
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(outputFileName), compareOptions);
}
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the documents have been compared successfully and provide the location of the output file:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocuments compared successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Now you have successfully compared multiple documents using GroupDocs Comparison for .NET. Utilize this capability to enhance your document processing applications efficiently.
