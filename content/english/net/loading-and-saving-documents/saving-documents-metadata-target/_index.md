# Saving Documents Metadata Target in GroupDocs Comparison for .NET

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of saving document metadata target using GroupDocs Comparison for .NET. GroupDocs Comparison for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to compare and merge documents in your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs Comparison for .NET: Ensure you have downloaded and installed GroupDocs Comparison for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: You should have a .NET development environment set up on your system.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start coding, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name
First, specify the output directory where you want to save the compared documents and the name of the output file.
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.docx");
```
## Step 2: Compare Documents and Save Metadata Target
Now, initialize a `Comparer` object with the source document and add the target document(s) you want to compare. Then, call the `Compare` method and specify the output file name along with the save options to clone metadata type as target.
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("SOURCE.docx"))
{
    comparer.Add("TARGET.docx");
    comparer.Compare(outputFileName, new SaveOptions() { CloneMetadataType = MetadataType.Target });
}
```
## Step 3: Display Success Message
Finally, display a success message indicating that the documents have been compared successfully and provide the path where the output file is saved.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocuments compared successfully.\nCheck output in {outputDirectory}.");
```
Congratulations! You have successfully saved documents metadata target using GroupDocs Comparison for .NET.
