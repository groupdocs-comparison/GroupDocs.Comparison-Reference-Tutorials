# Extract Document Info from .NET Comparison Results - Complete Guide

## Introduction

When you're working with document comparisons in .NET applications, you often need more than just the differences between files. Sometimes you need to extract document info from comparison results - things like file types, page counts, and document sizes. This is especially useful when you're building document management systems, audit trails, or automated reporting tools.

GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET makes this process straightforward, allowing you to retrieve comprehensive document metadata from your comparison results. Whether you're processing hundreds of documents or just need quick insights into a single comparison, this guide will show you exactly how to extract document info efficiently and reliably.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to retrieve document information from comparison results, understand what data you can access, and discover practical ways to use this information in your .NET applications.

## When You'll Need to Extract Document Info

Before diving into the code, let's look at some common scenarios where extracting document info from comparison results becomes essential:

**Document Processing Workflows**: When you're handling multiple document formats in batch operations, you need to know file types and sizes to route documents correctly or apply format-specific processing rules.

**Audit and Compliance**: Many organizations require detailed logs of document comparisons, including metadata about the files being compared. This information helps maintain compliance trails and supports legal discovery processes.

**Performance Optimization**: Understanding document sizes and page counts helps you optimize comparison operations. You might want to handle large documents differently or apply specific settings based on document characteristics.

**User Interface Enhancement**: If you're building applications where users upload and compare documents, displaying file information (type, size, page count) improves the user experience and helps users verify they're comparing the right files.

## Prerequisites

Before you start extracting document info from comparison results, make sure you have these essentials in place:

1. **GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET**: Install the GroupDocs.Comparison library from [the official releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/). The library supports .NET Framework 4.6.1+ and .NET Core 2.0+.

2. **Development Environment**: Set up your .NET development environment with Visual Studio, VS Code, or your preferred IDE. Ensure you have the necessary project configurations and NuGet package management set up.

3. **Sample Documents**: Prepare your source and target document files for testing. Common formats like `SOURCE.docx` and `TARGET.docx` work well for initial testing, but the API supports over 50 document formats including PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.

## Import Namespaces

First, you'll need to import the essential namespaces to access GroupDocs.Comparison functionalities in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
using GroupDocs.Comparison.Interfaces;
```

These imports give you access to the core comparison features, file handling capabilities, and the interfaces needed to extract document information from your comparison results.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Extract Document Info

Now let's walk through the process of retrieving document information from comparison results. This approach gives you detailed insights into the documents you're working with.

## Step 1: Initialize Comparer with Source Document

```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(File.OpenRead("SOURCE.docx")))
{
```

This step creates a new `Comparer` instance with your source document. We're using a `using` statement here, which is a best practice because it automatically handles resource disposal - even if an exception occurs during processing. The `File.OpenRead()` method opens the document as a read-only stream, which is memory-efficient for large files.

**Pro Tip**: If you're working with documents stored in different locations (cloud storage, databases, or network drives), you can pass any `Stream` object to the Comparer constructor, not just file paths.

## Step 2: Add Target Document for Comparison

```csharp
comparer.Add(File.OpenRead("TARGET.docx"));
```

Here, you're adding the target document to your comparison operation. The `Add()` method is flexible - you can add multiple target documents if you need to compare one source against several targets. This is particularly useful when you're tracking how a document has evolved through multiple versions.

**Important Note**: The order you add documents can matter for some comparison operations, especially when you're dealing with complex formatting or when generating comparison reports.

## Step 3: Retrieve Document Info from Result Document

```csharp
IDocumentInfo info = comparer.Targets.FirstOrDefault().GetDocumentInfo();
```

This is where the magic happens. The `Targets` collection contains all the target documents you've added, and `FirstOrDefault()` gets the first one. The `GetDocumentInfo()` method extracts comprehensive metadata including file type, page count, document size, and other properties depending on the document format.

**Understanding the Data**: The returned `IDocumentInfo` object contains standardized information that works across all supported document formats. This means you can use the same code to extract info from Word documents, PDFs, Excel sheets, and more.

## Step 4: Display Document Info

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nFile type: {0}\nNumber of pages: {1}\nDocument size: {2} bytes", info.FileType, info.PageCount, info.Size);
```

Finally, you're displaying the extracted information. In a real application, you'd typically store this data in a database, include it in reports, or use it to make processing decisions. The three main properties you'll use most often are:

- **FileType**: The document format (e.g., DOCX, PDF, XLSX)
- **PageCount**: Total number of pages or slides
- **Size**: Document size in bytes

## Common Use Cases and Practical Applications

**Batch Document Processing**: When processing multiple documents, you can use the file type information to apply format-specific processing rules or route documents to appropriate handlers.

**Storage Management**: Document size information helps you manage storage quotas and optimize file organization. You might archive larger documents separately or compress files above certain size thresholds.

**User Feedback**: In web applications, showing users the page count and file size before they start a comparison helps set expectations for processing time, especially with larger documents.

**Quality Assurance**: Comparing expected vs. actual page counts can help identify corrupted files or incomplete document uploads before processing begins.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**File Access Problems**: If you encounter "file not found" or "access denied" errors, ensure your application has proper read permissions and the file paths are correct. Consider using absolute paths during development.

**Memory Issues with Large Files**: For very large documents, consider using file streams instead of loading entire files into memory. The GroupDocs.Comparison API is designed to handle large files efficiently through streaming.

**Null Reference Exceptions**: Always check if `FirstOrDefault()` returns null, especially when working with dynamic document sets. Add null checking to make your code more robust:

```csharp
var targetDoc = comparer.Targets.FirstOrDefault();
if (targetDoc != null)
{
    IDocumentInfo info = targetDoc.GetDocumentInfo();
    // Process document info
}
```

**Format-Specific Limitations**: Some document formats may not provide all metadata properties. For example, plain text files might not have meaningful page counts. Always check if properties are available before using them.

## Performance Considerations

**Stream Management**: Always use `using` statements or manually dispose of streams to prevent memory leaks, especially in high-volume applications or long-running services.

**Caching Strategies**: If you're processing the same documents repeatedly, consider caching document information to avoid redundant extraction operations.

**Batch Operations**: When processing multiple documents, consider batching operations to improve overall performance and reduce system resource usage.

## Best Practices for Production Use

**Error Handling**: Wrap your document info extraction in try-catch blocks to handle scenarios where documents might be corrupted or in unsupported formats.

**Logging**: Log document information extraction operations, especially in production environments. This helps with troubleshooting and provides audit trails.

**Security**: Be cautious when displaying file paths or detailed document information to end users, as this might expose sensitive system information.

**Resource Management**: In web applications or services, ensure proper disposal of Comparer instances to prevent memory leaks and file handle exhaustion.

## Advanced Scenarios

**Multiple Target Documents**: If you've added multiple target documents, you can iterate through all of them and extract information from each:

```csharp
foreach (var target in comparer.Targets)
{
    IDocumentInfo info = target.GetDocumentInfo();
    // Process each target's information
}
```

**Conditional Processing**: Use the extracted information to make processing decisions. For example, you might apply different comparison settings based on document size or type.

**Integration with Databases**: Store extracted document information in your database for future reference, reporting, or analytics purposes.
