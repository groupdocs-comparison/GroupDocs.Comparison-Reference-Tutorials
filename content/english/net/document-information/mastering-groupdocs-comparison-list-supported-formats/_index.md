# How to List All Supported File Formats in GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET

## Introduction

Are you trying to figure out which file formats are supported by the GroupDocs.Comparison library? Whether you're a developer enhancing your document comparison tool or curious about this powerful library, this guide is perfect for you. Here, we'll explore how to list all supported file types using GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET.

**What You’ll Learn:**

- How to set up and configure the GroupDocs.Comparison library in your .NET projects
- Step-by-step instructions on retrieving and displaying a list of supported file formats
- Best practices for optimizing performance when working with this powerful comparison tool

With these skills, you'll be well-equipped to utilize the full potential of GroupDocs.Comparison. Let's dive into what you need before getting started.

## Prerequisites

Before listing supported file types, ensure your environment is ready:
- **Libraries and Versions:** Have .NET Core or a compatible .NET Framework version installed on your machine.
- **Dependencies:** Add the GroupDocs.Comparison library via NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI as described below.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of C# programming and familiarity with command-line tools for package management will help you follow along smoothly.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET

To begin, install the GroupDocs.Comparison library. Here's how:

### NuGet Package Manager Console

```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Comparison -Version 25.4.0
```

### .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Comparison --version 25.4.0
```

Once installed, set up your license for GroupDocs.Comparison. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license if needed. To purchase a license for long-term use, visit the official [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

After setting up your environment and acquiring a license, initialize the library in your project:

```csharp
// Initialize GroupDocs.Comparison
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("your-license-file.lic"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

This sets you up to utilize all features offered by GroupDocs.Comparison.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation process into clear, manageable steps.

### List and Print Supported File Types

In this section, we'll retrieve and display a sorted list of file types supported by GroupDocs.Comparison using C#.

#### Step 1: Retrieve Supported File Types

First, get all supported file types. This involves calling `GetSupportedFileTypes()`, which returns an enumerable collection of `FileType` objects.

```csharp
// Retrieve a sorted list of supported file formats.
IEnumerable<FileType> fileTypes = FileType.GetSupportedFileTypes().OrderBy(fileType => fileType.Extension);
```

#### Step 2: Print File Type Details

Next, iterate through each file type and print its details. This uses the `Console.WriteLine()` method to display information about each format.

```csharp
// Iterate through each file type and output its properties.
foreach (FileType fileType in fileTypes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fileType);
}
```

#### Explanation

- **Parameters:** The `GetSupportedFileTypes()` method does not require any parameters; it returns a comprehensive list of all supported formats.
- **Return Value:** This method returns an enumerable collection of `FileType` objects, each representing a format that GroupDocs.Comparison can handle.
- **Configuration Options:** Sorting by extension ensures the output is organized and easy to read.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure your license file path is correct if you encounter licensing issues.
- Verify the version number in your installation command matches the latest or required version for compatibility.

## Practical Applications

Understanding which file formats are supported can aid in several real-world scenarios:

1. **Document Management Systems:** Integrate this feature to inform users about compatible document types they can upload and compare.
2. **Developer Tools:** Build plugins or add-ons that leverage GroupDocs.Comparison’s capabilities, enhancing productivity tools like IDEs.
3. **File Conversion Services:** Use the list of supported formats to guide file conversion processes within your applications.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Comparison:
- **Resource Management:** Keep memory usage in check by disposing of objects once they are no longer needed.
- **Optimization Tips:** Utilize asynchronous operations where possible to improve responsiveness and reduce load times.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update your library version to benefit from the latest performance improvements.
