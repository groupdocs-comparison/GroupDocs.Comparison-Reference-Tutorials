string outputDirectory = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "RESULT.docx");
```
## Step 2: Open Source and Target Document Streams
Open streams for both the source and target documents you want to compare. Replace `"SOURCE.docx"` and `"TARGET.docx"` with the paths to your source and target documents respectively.
```csharp
using (Stream sourceStream = File.OpenRead("SOURCE.docx"))
using (Stream targetStream = File.OpenRead("TARGET.docx"))
{
```
## Step 3: Initialize Comparer and Add Documents
Create an instance of the `Comparer` class and add the target document for comparison using the `Add` method.
```csharp
using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer(sourceStream))
{
    comparer.Add(targetStream);
```
## Step 4: Perform Comparison and Save Output
Execute the comparison process and save the compared document to the specified output file using the `Compare` method.
```csharp
    comparer.Compare(File.Create(outputFileName));
}
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the documents have been compared successfully and provide the path to the output directory.
