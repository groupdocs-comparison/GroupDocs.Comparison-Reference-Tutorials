- **Temporary License**: Obtain for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Get full access with no limitations.

Here's a basic initialization example in C#:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Comparison;
// Initialize comparer object
Comparer comparer = new Comparer("source.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide
### Protect Result Document by Password
This feature secures the resultant document from your comparison with a password.

#### Overview
We will use GroupDocs.Comparison to compare two documents and save the output with a specified password.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation (H3)
1. **Create Comparer Instance**
   Start by creating an instance of `Comparer` with your source document:
   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.IO;
   using GroupDocs.Comparison;
   using GroupDocs.Comparison.Options;

   string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputFileName = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "result.docx");

   // Initialize comparer with the source document path.
   using (Comparer comparer = new Comparer("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/source.docx"))
   {
       ...
   }
   ```
2. **Add Target Document**
   Add your target document to compare against:
   ```csharp
   comparer.Add("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/target.docx");
   ```
3. **Configure Compare Options**
   Set options for password saving behavior:
   ```csharp
   CompareOptions cOptions = new CompareOptions
   {
       PasswordSaveOption = PasswordSaveOption.User // Specify who can access the document.
   };
   ```
4. **Define Save Options with Password**
   Ensure the resultant file is saved with a password:
   ```csharp
   SaveOptions sOptions = new SaveOptions
   {
       Password = "3333" // Set your desired password here.
   };
   ```
5. **Perform Comparison and Save Result**
   Compare the documents and save the result with configured options:
   ```csharp
   comparer.Compare(outputFileName, sOptions, cOptions);
   ```

#### Parameters and Configuration
- `CompareOptions.PasswordSaveOption`: Determines who can access the protected document.
- `SaveOptions.Password`: Sets the password for the resultant file.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Error: File Not Found**: Verify your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Ensure your application has permissions to read/write files in specified directories.

## Practical Applications
Here are some use cases for this feature:
1. **Legal Document Management**: Securely save comparison results of legal documents for confidential review.
2. **Financial Reports**: Protect sensitive financial data by password-protecting compared reports before sharing.
3. **Project Documentation**: Ensure only authorized team members access changes in project documentation.

Integration with other .NET systems, such as ASP.NET applications or Windows services, is straightforward, allowing you to incorporate document comparison and protection seamlessly into your existing workflows.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimization Tips
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple comparisons in batches to optimize resource usage.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of resources properly using `using` statements to free up memory efficiently.

### Best Practices
- **Efficient File Handling**: Only open and process files when necessary to minimize I/O operations.
- **Monitor Resource Usage**: Regularly check application performance metrics to identify potential bottlenecks.
