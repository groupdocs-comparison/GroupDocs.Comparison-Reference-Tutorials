```
Or using **.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Comparison --version 25.4.0
```

### Acquiring a License

Once installed, you'll need to acquire a license for GroupDocs.Comparison:
1. **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial from the official [GroupDocs website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/comparison/net/).
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license via their [temporary license page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) to explore full capabilities.
3. **Purchase**: For continuous use, purchase a commercial license from the [purchase portal](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Comparison in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;

public class LicenseSetup {
    public static void InitializeLicense() {
        // Your code to set up the license goes here.
    }
}
```

Now, let’s delve into setting the license from a file.

## Implementation Guide

### Setting License From File

This feature ensures your application is authorized by applying a valid license. Follow these steps to implement it:

#### Step 1: Verify License File Existence

Before setting the license, check if the file exists in your specified directory.

**Check and Set License Code:**
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Comparison;

public class LicenseSetup {
    public static void ApplyLicense(string documentDirectory) {
        // Check if the specified license path exists
        string licensePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "License.lic");
        
        if (File.Exists(licensePath)) {
            // Create a new License object
            License license = new License();
            
            // Set the license from file
            license.SetLicense(licensePath);
            Console.WriteLine("License applied successfully.");
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine("License file not found.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **File.Exists**: Checks if the specified license file exists at the given path.
- **SetLicense Method**: Applies the license to your application, ensuring it runs without evaluation limitations.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the license file path is correctly specified and accessible.
- Check for any typos in the license file name or path.
- Verify that the license hasn't expired or been revoked.

## Practical Applications
